## Overview

A data-driven visualization project focused on understanding the AI-driven job market for STEAM careers in the European Union. The project explores how STEAM students can strategically adapt their skills and career planning to remain competitive in an AI- and automation-driven job market.

## Research Question

> How can STEAM students in the EU strategically adapt their skills and career planning to remain competitive in an AI- and automation-driven job market in the next years?

## Visualizations

The project features multiple interactive visualizations built with **D3.js**:

- **Circular Packing Chart**: Highlights industries, job roles, and tools used by professionals in each industry
- **Chord Diagram**: Displays relationships between AI-powered tools and developer categories
- **Choropleth Map**: Visualizes STEM jobs forecasted by CEDEFOP from 2025 to 2035 across EU countries
- **Country-Specific Bar Charts**: Normalized visualizations showing forecasted STEM jobs per sector for Finland, France, Luxembourg, and Switzerland

## Dataset

Utilizes publicly available data from [Stack Overflow's Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/), enriched with forecasts from the CEDEFOP European Agency. The dataset was processed and cleaned using Python and Pandas.

## Key Insights

The visualizations reveal industry trends, tool preferences across developer categories, regional variations in STEM job forecasts, and sector-specific opportunities for STEAM graduates in the EU.
