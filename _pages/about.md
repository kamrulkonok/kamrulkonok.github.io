I specialize in Big Data Management, Deep Learning, and Foundation Models. I have hands-on experience building scalable pipelines and intelligent systems in healthcare and cybersecurity.

I have recently graduated with an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA) from CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay, with prior studies at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB). Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Engineering from Sichuan University, China. My academic journey has taken me across China, Belgium, Spain, and now France. I love learning new languages, and I speak English and Chinese fluently, as well as a bit of French. I am currently seeking PhD opportunities to further advance my research in AI and machine learning, with the goal of building a career as an academic researcher and contributing to advancements in the field of AI.


Most recently, I worked as a Research Engineer Intern at LISSI, Université Paris-Est Créteil, in collaboration with CEA–LIST, where I developed a hybrid LLM and rule-based framework for automating security annotation in business process models. I am currently working on this project for a dedicated publication. Previously, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at LISN, CentraleSupélec, on unsupervised deep-learning frameworks for medical imaging analysis. My work focuses on leveraging large language models, knowledge graphs, and advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in cybersecurity, medical imaging, and data analytics.
