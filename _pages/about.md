I am an AI Research Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that combine learning and reasoning.

**Education**  
I earned my <span style="color: #00a86b; font-weight: bold;">Erasmus Mundus Master's Degree in Big Data Management and Analytics</span> from CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay, with prior studies at UPC Barcelona and ULB Brussels. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Sichuan University, China.

**Research Highlights**  
My master's thesis, SecBPMN-GPT, introduces a hybrid framework that integrates large language models and RAG to automate cybersecurity annotations in business process models. Previously, I worked at LISN, CentraleSupélec, where I contributed to research on geometric deep learning frameworks for medical imaging.

**Expertise**  
I have hands-on experience with <span style="color: #00a86b; font-weight: bold;">Python, PyTorch, Large Language Models (LLMs), information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), medical imaging, and knowledge graphs</span>.

## Research Interests

Foundation Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Information Extraction, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Knowlegde Graphs

## Hobbies

Language Exchange, Tennis, Cycling, Traveling, Hiking
